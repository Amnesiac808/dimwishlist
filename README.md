# Steps to Add Custom Wishlists to DIM

Open Destiny Item Manager

Look for the gear icon (usually located in the top right corner) and click on it. This will take you to the DIM settings.

Scroll down until you find a section labeled "Wish Lists".

# Using an External Source:

In the provided text box, you can input the direct links to the wishlist files hosted on GitHub.
It's essential that these wishlists are hosted on GitHub, as DIM trusts GitHub as a source and might not load wishlists from other platforms.

# Inputting Your Wishlist URLs

For these specific wishlists, you can copy this input:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amnesiac808/dimwishlist/main/Speedrunner's_Shopping_List_(Aegis).txt|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amnesiac808/dimwishlist/main/Equipment%20for%20Boss%20Damage%20(Aegis).txt

Make sure the URLs are separated by the "|" character.

Click update wishlist source below the textbox.

# Saving and Using Your Wishlists

After inputting the URLs, you might need to save or refresh DIM for the wishlists to take effect.
Once loaded, any items in your inventory that match the criteria of your wishlist will have a green thumbs-up icon.
To quickly search for wishlist items in DIM, you can use the Item Search: is:wishlist.

# Additional Tips:

If your wishlist has specific notes (e.g., "gambit"), you can search for them using wishlistnotes:gambit.
Clicking "clear wish lists" will remove both the file and external source, so use this option if you want to start over.
