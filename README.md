# Aegis DIM Wishlists

Welcome! This guide will help you integrate these custom wishlists into your Destiny Item Manager (DIM).

## Wishlists

- **Weapons for Boss Damage**: [View Wishlist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amnesiac808/dimwishlist/main/Weapons_for_Boss_Damage_(Aegis).txt)
  
- **Speed Running Shopping List**: [View Wishlist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amnesiac808/dimwishlist/main/Speedrunner's_Shopping_List_(Aegis).txt)

## How to Add Custom Wishlists to DIM

1. **Accessing DIM Settings**:
   - Open [Destiny Item Manager](https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/).
   - Click on the gear icon (usually located in the top right corner) to access the DIM settings.

2. **Navigating to Wishlists**:
   - Scroll until you find the "Wish Lists" section.

3. **Using an External Source for Wishlists**:
   - Paste the following links into the provided textbox. Ensure the URLs are separated by the `|` character:
     ```
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amnesiac808/dimwishlist/main/Weapons_for_Boss_Damage_(Aegis).txt|
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amnesiac808/dimwishlist/main/Speedrunner's_Shopping_List_(Aegis).txt
     ```
   - If you prefer to use the wishlists individually, you can paste either link alone without the | separator.  
   - Note: It's crucial that these wishlists are hosted on GitHub as DIM primarily trusts wishlists from this platform.

4. **Updating and Activating the Wishlists**:
   - Click "update wishlist source" below the textbox.
   - You may need to refresh DIM for the changes to take effect. Once activated, wishlist items in your inventory will be highlighted with a green thumbs-up icon.
   - To find items from your wishlist, use the search term `is:wishlist` in DIM.

5. **Tips**:
   - For items with specific notes (e.g., "gambit"), use the search term `wishlistnotes:gambit`.
   - To reset and clear all wishlists, click "clear wish lists".
